Upon the release of Youtube shorts, I initially embraced the concept with enthusiasm. However, I soon realized that the addictive nature of shorts was negatively impacting my productivity. Despite attempts with a friend to teach the Youtube algorithm our disinterest by clicking the "not interested" button, the shorts continued to be recommended to us. </br>

Eventually, my frustration with Youtube shorts reached a boiling point, leading me to take drastic measures to eliminate them from my feed. To achieve this, I developed a plugin (currently available only for Google Chrome) that effectively removes any and all references to shorts from users Youtube experience.
